# 3MF-Info
3MF-Info is a simple metatag editor for Orca-Flashforge files.
Orca-Flashforge users up to the current version 1.4.2 cannot add or edit model information in the project tab.
With 3MF-Info, you can extract the 3mf file and edit the metatags in the 3dmodel.model file. The program was developed in PureBasic 6.11 LTS (Windows - x64) and is completely free to use, copy, distribute, or modify.
Trust is not a given in this world, so if you are skeptical, download the source code and compile your own version. Otherwise, download the free 3MF-Info.exe program. To download or purchase a PureBasic version, go to: https://www.purebasic.com/
